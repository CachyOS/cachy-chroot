# cachy-chroot

Simple helper program to simplify chroot into a CachyOS installation (or any Arch Linux based installation). It lists all the partitions discovered on the machine and also supports listing BTRFS subvolumes, the user just needs to specify their root partition and any additional partitions to be mounted, the rest is taken care by the script (mounting, chroot, and unmounting)
